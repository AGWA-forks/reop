An idea springs out of his forehead fully formed, with no warning. This is how
all the best ideas arrive. Ideas that he patiently cultivates from tiny seeds
always fail to germinate or else grow up into monstrosities. Good ideas are
just there all of a sudden, like angels in the Bible. You cannot ignore them
just because they are ridiculous.
